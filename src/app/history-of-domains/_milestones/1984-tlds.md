There were six original _top-level domains_ (TLDs): `.com`, `.org`, `.net`, `.edu`, `.gov`, and `.mil`.

These extensions were defined in RFC 920 in October 1984 but not live until 1985. In his book, _Declaring Independence in Cyberspace_, Milton Mueller credits internet pioneer Jon Postel:

> Postel played a leading role in defining the original top-level domains (.mil, .gov, .edu, .org, .net, .com)

This was five years before Tim Berners-Lee would propose the World Wide Web, so _domains preceded the Web!_
