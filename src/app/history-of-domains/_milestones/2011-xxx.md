title: Porn TLD .xxx gets approved
---

`.xxx` was first proposed in 2000 by ICM Registry as a dedicated TLD for adult content, like pornography. Advocates argued that it would be better to silo adult content in its own TLD, which would make it easier for parents, schools, and employers to filter. `.xxx` had many opponents and was shut down by the NTIA in 2004 during the Bush administration.

ICM later appealed the ruling through ICANNâ€™s independent review process and won, paving the way for other TLDs like `.sex` and `.porn`.
