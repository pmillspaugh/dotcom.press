GoDaddy—probably still the most widely known registrar—ran their first Super Bowl ad in 2005. Andy Reid still coached the Eagles back then, who lost to the Belichick-Brady Patriots 24-21. Pro racing driver Danica Patrick became the prominent spokesperson for GoDaddy starting in the 2009 Super Bowl.
