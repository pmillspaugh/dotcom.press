title: Ukraine asks ICANN to remove Russian domains
---

In February 2022, Ukraine asked ICANN to shut down Russian domains `.ru` and `.рф`. ICANN declined.

> ...the Ukrainian government proposed to ICANN that it should remove the top-level domains for Russia (.ru, .рф) from the DNS root registry. ICANN's board flatly refused to do this, but if it had, it would have disrupted Internet connectivity, both inside and outside Russia. Anyone using a Russian domain might not be able to communicate with people on an ICANN-supported domain. ICANN's refusal to follow the Ukrainian request evinced a clear policy choice: global Internet compatibility is more important than the foreign policy goals of any one government.
