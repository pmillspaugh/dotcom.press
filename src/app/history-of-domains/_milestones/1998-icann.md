ICANN is the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. What sounds like boring, bureacratic alphabet soup has actually been the center of constant geopolitical controversy over the years.

When money entered the chat in the mid 90s people started questioning the informal governance run by Jon Postel and Co. Businesses, trademark lawyers, the Clinton administration, governments, civil society groups, and the technical community itself all had their own perspectives (protect trademarks! block unsavory internet content! donâ€™t censor the web! etc.).

The NTIA, part of the US Commerce Department, wrote a whitepaper in June 1998 proposing ICANN to resolve thorny governance issues. ICANN launched in November.
