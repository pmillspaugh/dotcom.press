Jon Postel passed away just 10 days before the ICANN announcement. He was set to serve on ICANN’s board. Milton Mueller:

> Sadly, the one person everyone respected, the only one who could lend this gang of strangers legitimacy—Jon Postel—died 10 days before the move was made public.

Tim Berners-Lee again:

> Jon managed IANA as a public trust, a neutral party. Much of the growth of the Web and Internet dependent on his integrity as the ultimate trusted authority who saw to it that the delegation of domain names was fair, impartial, and as unfettered as possible. Because of the sort of person Jon was, it worked. The Web and Internet as a whole owe a lot to Jon, who died in October 1998 at age fifty-five.
