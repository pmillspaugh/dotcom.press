Domain registration was free for the first two years until September 1995 when Network Solutions started charging $100 for a two-year registration and $50 for yearly renewal thereafter. The National Science Foundation had been subsidizing admin costs before that point. In April 1998, Network Solutions lowered registration fees to $70 for two years and $35 per year renewal.
