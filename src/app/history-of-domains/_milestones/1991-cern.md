Tim Berners-Lee proposed the World Wide Web in 1989 while working at CERN in Switzerland and put up the first website in 1991. It’s still live today at [info.cern.ch](https://info.cern.ch)!

In _Weaving the Web_, TBL talks about the domain’s role:

> I registered an alias for it—"info.cern.ch"—with the CERN computer system folks. That way, the server would not be tied by its address to my machine; if I ever moved its contents to another machine, all the hypertext links pointing to it could find it.
