The US government’s contract with IANA (through its NTIA agency in the Commerce Department) expired on September 30, 2016 after a major political battle both inside the US and around the world.

Since its inception in 1998, ICANN was supposed to be a global organization not controlled by governments. Pressure to undo the US’s outsized power boiled over after Edward Snowden leaked thousands of classified NSA documents revealing widespread US surveillance in 2013.

Milton Mueller’s book _Declaring Independence in Cyberspace_ focuses on this fascinating transition and its implications both in the last decade and looking ahead at the future of internet governance.
