Network Solutions’ monopoly over domain registration ended in 1999 at the direction of ICANN, but they retained registry rights over `.com`, `.net`, and `.org` (for the time being).

Net Sol began selling domains wholesale for $9 a piece to other ICANN-accredited registrars who’d turn around and mark up domains sold to end customers. The wholesale price dropped again, from $9 to $6, in January 2000.
