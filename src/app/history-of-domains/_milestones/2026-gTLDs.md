A new round of gTLDs—the first since 2012—will open in April 2026. The base application fee is $227,000 for companies to apply for new extensions, with auctions of last resort as a possibility for competing bids.

The 2026 round will be one of the major topics at ICANN84 in Dublin ([email me](mailto:pete@dotcom.press) if you’ll be there!). Whether you are a diehard dot com believer or not, there’s no doubt generic extensions will to continue to proliferate across the web.
