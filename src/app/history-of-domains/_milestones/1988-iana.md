The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority formed officially in 1988 (via RFC 1083) to manage globally unique IP addresses. Jon Postel and Joyce Reynolds at USC had been running things informally for years, and they continued to run it for the better part of the next decade. As Milton Mueller put it:

> In effect, Jon Postel was the registry personified.

And as Tim-Berners Lee wrote in his (first) book:

> IANA was set up, was run by, and basically _was_ the late Jon Postel...
