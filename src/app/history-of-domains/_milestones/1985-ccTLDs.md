Jon Postel also set up the first _country-code top-level domain_ (ccTLD): `.us` in February 1985. Later that year `.uk` (United Kingdom) and `.il` (Israel) were established, and dozens more followed. Now there are [316 ccTLDs](/archive/1592-tlds), including many popular ones that arenâ€™t often associated with the country:

- `.ai` ([Anguilla](/archive/anguilla))
- `.io` (British Indian Ocean Territory)
- `.co` (Colombia)
- `.me` (Montenegro)
- `.tv` (Tuvalu)
- `.sh` (Saint Helena)
- `.fm` (Federated States of Micronesia)

In fact, _any two-letter extension you see belongs to a country!_
