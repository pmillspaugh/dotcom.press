title: Verisign acquires Network Solutions for $21 billion
---

Verisign has been called a monopoly as the sole registry of `.com` and `.net`, with over 170 million registrations as of Q2 2025, earning about $1.5 billion annually. By 2000 they held 80% of the entire domain market. To their credit, they claim 100% reliability in over 28 years of DNS queries—pretty amazing!

They also run one of 13 root nameservers (along with 11 other orgs including NASA, ICANN, and University of Maryland). Verisign was founded in 1995, took over the `.com` registry around 1999, acquired Net Sol in 2000, then later divested the registrar business. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway invested in Verisign in 2012.
