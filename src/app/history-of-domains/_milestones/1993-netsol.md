The Web wasn’t even open for commercial use until 1992 when Congress updated the National Science Foundation Act. In 1993 the U.S. government awarded a five-year contract to run domain registrations to Network Solutions, a then small IT company in Northern Virginia. They had trouble keeping up with registration demand. Per David Kesmodel in his book, _The Domain Game_:

> Eventually Network Solutions’ tiny staff...became so overwhelmed by the flood of e-mailed applications that it was unable to carefully screen each request...[Net Sol] gave up trying to prevent multiple registrations by the same person or company. It also dropped efforts to allocate domains to specific types of registrants...It was basically a free-for-all.
