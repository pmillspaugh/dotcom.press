ICANN launched its first major expansion round of gTLDs in January 2012, which brought us over a thousand new extensions like `.app`, `.pizza`, and `.sex`.

Google won 46 strings, like `.dev` and `.dad`, paying $25 million in an auction for `.app` alone. Amazon owns 54, like `.wow` and `.prime`. Whole companies sprung up, like Donuts (now Identity Digital) which raised hundreds of millions to build a portfolio of 270+ TLDs like `.cool`, `.run`, and `.studio`.

You can explore all 1,592 TLDs [here](/tld-wiki):
