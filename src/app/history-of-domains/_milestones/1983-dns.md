Paul Mockapetris invented the Domain Name System at USC to map names (domains) to numbers (IP addresses). While DNS is an amazing system of global coordination, it is a point of centralization in an otherwise decentralized Internet. As Tim-Berners Lee put it in _Weaving the Web:_

> For all its decentralized growth, the Web currently has one centralized Achillesâ€™ heel by which it can all be brought down or controlled.
