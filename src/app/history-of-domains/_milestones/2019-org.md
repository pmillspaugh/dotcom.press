title: $1.1 billion .org sale blocked
---

In November 2019 the Public Interest Registry (PIR) agreed to sell `.org` to a Private Equity group including former ICANN CEO Fadi Chehad√© for $1.1 billion. Tim Berners-Lee and others opposed the sale. The reason PIR existed in the first place was to divest `.org` from Verisign in 2002. The ICANN board pulled the plug on the deal in April 2020, saying it was "the right thing to do."
