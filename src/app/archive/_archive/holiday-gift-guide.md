A domain can be a wonderful, touching gift for the right friend or family member. I’m thinking of that creative sibling or friend of yours who you think ought to share their work with the world. I don’t mean _work_ in the sense that it must be polished or professional or feel like “work” at all. By _work_ I mean writing, music, photography, drawing, dancing, recipes, a tutorial on replacing the headlights of a 2005 Subaru Forester, whatever.

You can buy domains for your children, too! They might want it someday to publish their art or music, write, share recipes, or for something else entirely that we can’t yet imagine. Setting up a website could be a fun project to work on together with them.

## Your corner of the internet

A personal website can be literally anything you want it to be. And that’s the point—it’s yours. _Your corner of the Internet._ The walled gardens of social media will come and go, but a domain is your space. The algorithm won’t change on you overnight.

If you don’t own _your_ own domain yet, I hope you’ll buy one as a gift to yourself first. I feel strongly that you should own a personal domain, even if you don’t know what to do with it yet. A personal website can be a low stakes creative outlet, a powerful career building tool, or anything in between. At worst, it’s ten dollars a year for a blank canvas waiting for you whenever you’re ready<sup>1</sup>.

I often tell people that no one will visit your website at first, _and that’s a good thing_. People will only go there if you send them a link. That means you have time to explore, to experiment, to tinker. You can find your voice and style over time. Again, you’re not beholden to that algorithm everyone is always talking about. When you start out, your website is a little forest where your trees fall silently.

## Same day delivery

Unlike many holiday gifts, this one takes five minutes, and there’s no shipping involved. Go to your favorite registrar<sup>2</sup> and look up `firstlast.com`. If it’s available, grab it! Or better yet, if you can get `lastname.com`, then you can have `first@lastname.com` as your email (and so can everyone in your family).

You don’t have to go with a dot com, of course. There are [hundreds of expressive alternatives](https://www.dotcom.press/tld-wiki) to consider: `.art`, `.food`, `.me`, `.mom`, `.dad`, `.beer`, `.cool`, `.earth`, `.wtf`, `.fyi`, `.christmas`, and on and on. I own `pete.garden` because my blog is a [digital](https://www.petemillspaugh.com/about#garden) [garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). I love the artistic touch of choosing a domain ending that fits your taste, but I do also like owning my full name dot com because it’s my name and my identity.

I’ve bought domains for a handful of friends and family members over the years (which, btw, if you’re keeping track, was well before I had the idea to write a book about domains). My brother spent an hour or so setting up a simple website where he can share videos of himself playing guitar and singing, for example. As far as I can tell—and I do think it’s hard to pretend liking a gift—the domains I’ve given have been well received. When I gift a domain, I always tell the recipient that it includes me as a consultant of sorts for website building and brainstorming purposes. If I have given you a domain and you’re reading this now, that offer still stands!

## Footnotes

_(1) A domain is a gift that keeps on giving—er, that \_you_ keep on giving—because domains must be renewed yearly. $10.46 for a dot com is not bad, though (cheaper than most burritos), so hopefully the financial burden doesn’t stop you.\_

_(2) I buy domains on Cloudflare, but there are tons of other registrars (Vercel, Porkbun, Squarespace, etc.). A dot com should cost you about $11. I also like instantdomainsearch.com for searching domains (it’s not a registrar, but they link to registrars)._
