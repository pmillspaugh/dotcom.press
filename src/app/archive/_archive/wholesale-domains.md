If you've ever bought a domain, you know what a _registrar_ is. It's where you buy a domain. GoDaddy pays millions for 30 second Super Bowl ads, so actually pretty much everyone knows what a registrar is. What you might not know is what a _registry_ is.

If you do know what a registry is, sorry—the point is that most people don't. And I'm not saying there isn't more to registrars. They do more than sell domains: they upsell you email hosting, website building, and plenty more<sup>1</sup>. Some registrars even dabble in questionable behavior, like investing in their own domain portfolio using _your_ search queries to decide which domains are sought after and therefore valuable. There are thousands of registrars, and their history has plenty of controversy and intrigue. But I'm not writing about registrars (for now—I'll certainly cover them later). I'm writing about their lesser known sibling, registries.

For every top-level domain (TLD) out there—and there are thousands—there's a registry that manages it. `.com`, `.org`, `.xyz`, `.club`, `.ventures`: they're all owned and managed by a registry. A company called Verisign operates both `.com` and `.net`. They sell `.com` domains wholesale to _registrars_ who turn around and sell them to customers for a (thin) profit<sup>2</sup>. The current going rate Verisign charges registrars for a dot com is $10.26 per year. **Verisign maintains over 170 million registrations of `.com` and `.net` domains, which means it earns over $1.5 billion in annual revenue from registrations alone.<sup>3</sup>** (Berkshire Hathaway is a longtime Verisign investor, btw.)

I mentioned there are thousands of TLDs. `.you`, `.music`, and `.now` are among a dozen or so new TLDs being rolled out this year. So how do they come about?

Domains were something of a wild west in the early- to mid-90s, so in 1998 a nonprofit with a mouthful of a name was set up for domain governance: the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN (pronounced "I can" as in "I can help you get a name for the internet"). Registries sign agreements with ICANN that grant permission to run a TLD so long as they meet technical, operational, and financial requirements.

Registries bid for rights to TLDs in auctions run by ICANN. Sometimes they pay a lot. Blogging platform Automattic/WordPress<sup>4</sup> paid $19 million for the rights to `.blog` in 2016. They made a big bet that bloggers would pay up for memorable domains. And they decide how much to charge. For example, `pete.blog` is a "premium" domain, so they're charging $500/yr for it. Whereas `petemillspaugh.blog` is only $20/yr. But `pete.blog` is available! No Pete out there wants it, especially when there are expressive alternatives like `pete.garden` for $24/yr and `pete.football` for $18/yr. Even though WordPress is still widely used, I have a hard time believing Automattic made back $20 million on `.blog`.

The range of TLD prices is kind of shocking. A registry for REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) sells `.reit` domains for a cool $1,000 per year. Another registry charges just $11 yearly for `.xyz` domains. Back to Verisign, they've caught backlash from recent price hikes on `.com`. They have a contract allowing price increases up to 7% per year for four years, and they've pretty much scraped up every last penny of that. In their defense, secondary market sales of dot coms are as strong as ever, and they are a for-profit company trying to return money to shareholders. But it's murky. ICANN is a nonprofit whose mission is to "ensure a stable, secure, and unified global Internet", and ICANN is who negotiates agreements with registries like Verisign. But, but, but—Verisign heavily funds ICANN. Verisign is ICANN's largest financial backer. As anti-monopoly policy wonk Laurel Kilgour puts it:

> Verisign's monopoly over the .com top level domain is old enough to vote and drink<sup>5</sup>.

Verisign has been around since the early internet days, and there's a lot more to unpack there, which I'll save for another day. In the meantime, what about the other registries?

For some registries, it's all they do. That registry selling `.xyz` domains that I mentioned earlier is called XYZ, and they own the rights to 35 TLDs, like `.lol`, `.baby`, `.mom`, `.dad`, `.ceo`, and `.audio`. They say on their website that they've sold over 4 million domains. Another registry called Donuts raised over $100 million in venture capital to buy [hundreds of TLDs](https://identity.digital/tld-portfolio) (including what I think are some pretty good ones—like `.email`, `.space`, `.band`, `.pizza`—and ones I've used—like `.life` for [weeksofyour.life](https://weeksofyour.life)).

But there are also registries you've actually heard of—just not for their registry business. Google runs a registry. So does Amazon. Sometimes they bid for TLDs that'll become available to the public, like Google paying $25 million for rights to `.app`, but other times they acquire TLDs for internal or branded use, like Amazon's `.prime`.

Some TLDs get stuck in closed systems and long-running litigation, like Amazon's ownership of `.book`. Amazon won the rights without any intention to sell `.book` domains to the public, which Barnes & Noble and other booksellers have challenged as too generic of a term to be locked away for Amazon's exclusive use. I would've loved to have a `.book` domain for this book. Google is also up against legal challenges to its bid for generic TLDs, like `.search` (which Amazon also applied for!).

I haven't even touched on registries for ccTLDs (country code top-level domains, like `.de` for Germany and `.jp` for Japan). Some countries run their own registries, and others partner with registries to capitalize on what can be a meaningful asset (as `.ai` has been for Anguilla, `.me` for Montenegro, `.tv` for Tuvalu, and many more). Anguilla switched to a partnership this year with a registry I mentioned earlier, Donuts (now called Identity Digital), to meet surging demand for its `.ai` domains, for example.

## Reply

There's a lot about registries that I left out here in the interest of brevity. Reply with your unanswered questions, curiosities, and thoughts. Feedback helps me shape the book into something that resonates with you and other readers.

I'll be on a trip to Canada next week, so my next email won't be until September. Speaking of which, NYC friends: I'll be in town the week of 9/15! In the meantime, reply and forward to any friends or coworkers who you think would be interested in the book.
