      <p>
        In the context of book publishing, a{" "}
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colophon_(publishing)">
          <em>colophon</em>
        </a>{" "}
        is the imprint and blurb about the publisher that appears stamped in a
        book's backmatter. Web designers and programmers sometimes use{" "}
        <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/colophon">
          <em>colophon</em>
        </a>{" "}
        to mean 'how this site was made.' So I have the nerdy opportunity to use
        the word in both contexts!
