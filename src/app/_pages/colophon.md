# Colophon

In the context of book publishing, a [colophon](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colophon_(publishing)>) is the imprint and blurb about the publisher that appears stamped in a book's backmatter. Web designers and developers sometimes use [colophon](https://maggieappleton.com/colophon) to mean 'how this site was made.' So I have the nerdy opportunity to use the word in both contexts!
