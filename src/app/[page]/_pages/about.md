# About

Dot Com Press, LLC is a publisher designed for the internet age. Today, books can have rich, interactive websites and meet readers where they are: print (long live print!), but also web, ebook, audiobook, podcast, email newsletter, and beyond.

_dot com et al._ by [Pete Millspaugh](https://petemillspaugh.com) is Dot Com Press's opening act. If you're interested in publishing a book with us, email [hello@dotcom.press](mailto:hello@dotcom.press) to introduce yourself.
