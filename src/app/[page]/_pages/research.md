# Research

Interviews, books, articles, blogs, documentaries, podcasts, specs etc. form the foundation of _dot com et al_.

I've listed some burning questions just below that keep resurfacing in my head. If you have thoughts on those, or any domain stories, opinions, resources, or even questions to share please email [hello@dotcom.press](mailto:hello@dotcom.press).

## Burning questions

1. How important is dot com (versus alternative TLDs) now and into the future?
1. Is free market domain investing fair? (Or should there have been rules against domaining for purely financial gain)
1. Is it a problem that ICANN's biggest financial backer is Verisign? Does ICANN have other incentive problems?
1. Why did Google really sell Google Domains?

## Interviews

I'm interviewing lots of people for the book, so I may publish a list of who all I interviewed (with permission, of course).

## The fine print

_(1) Books include Bookshop.org affiliate links, so if you buy one I'll earn a 10% commission on the profit (but regardless of my affiliation, Bookshop.org is a terrific Amazon alternative and way to support independent bookstores)._
