# dotcom.press

Dot Com Press is a book publisher designed for the internet age, and [dotcom.press](https://dotcom.press) is its home.

## dot com et al.

_dot com et al._ explores the history, economics, and artistry of domains. I expect to publish it sometime in 2026, and it will be available in many forms: print, web, ebook, audiobook, email newsletter, podcast, etc.

## Technologies

### Cloudflare

I used [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) to register `dotcom.press` and set up email forwarding for `hello@dotcom.press` and `support@dotcom.press`.

### Val Town

I used [Val Town](https://val.town) to set up a custom email signup, verification, and sending workflow.

### Pagefind

Search is available thanks to [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app). I wrote a [tutorial on setting up Pagefind with Next.js](https://petemillspaugh.com/nextjs-search-with-pagefind), which covers both the pages and app routers.

### Commit Mono & Newsreader

The monospace text you see on `dotcom.press` is set in [Commit Mono](https://commitmono.com). Not only do I love this typeface (I use it in my editor), but its website is amazing. I also use [Newsreader](https://productiontype.com/font/newsreader) as the site's serif font.

### Next.js

This web app uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) with the app router.

### CSS modules

This app is styled using vanilla CSS via CSS modules.
